 * Question behaviour for question with hints in interactive mode.

 * Behaviour variables:
 * _triesleft - a number of tries student can still do (inherited from interactive)
 * _hashint - there was hint requested in the step
 * _render_<hintname> - true if hint with hintname should be rendered when rendering question next time
 *
 * Behaviour controls:
 * submit - submit answer to grading (inherited from interactive)
 * tryagain - start another try (inherited from interactive)
