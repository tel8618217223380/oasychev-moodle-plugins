Download the pcre library, replace pcretest with this one and build like this:

export LIBS=-licuuc
./configure --enable-utf --enable-unicode-properties
make

then you can run ./pcretest testdata/testinput1 cross_tests_from_pcre_testinput1.php

this modified version forces utf8 mode so some of tests (with incorrect utf8 bytes) are lost
